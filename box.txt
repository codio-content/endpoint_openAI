Paraphrase the following:
"Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format." 

The distance between two embeddings in the vector space corresponds with the semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format.
